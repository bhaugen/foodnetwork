foodnetwork is administrative software for food aggregation and distribution networks.

These are generally groups of farmers who aggregate food from many farmers and distribute it to many customers.

The system has been developed in collaboration with several working food networks.

This version of the software is now being used by 2 food networks in the Driftless region of western Wisconsin.

The developers are no longer working on this software because our friends at https://openfoodnetwork.org/ have created something better, so these days, we just recommend them.
