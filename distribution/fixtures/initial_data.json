In other words, lots will become unavailable \r\n        next week.\r\n        If you want all lots of a product to be available for longer, change the expiration days \r\n        for that product, and new lots will be available longer (but existing lots will not be changed). \r\n        If you want a particular lot or lots to be available longer, go into Admin and change the \r\n        expiration date on the lot (Inventory Item).\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Send Fresh List emails to customers</h3></li>\r\n<p> This feature is temporarily disabled for redesign.</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Enter orders</h3></li>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOrders may be entered by customers using their own section of the system,  \r\n\tor network staff may enter orders through the Order tab.\r\n        The form shows all available inventory items from all producers, and \r\n        you enter the quantities of each item that the current customer wants to order.  \r\n        You can also override unit prices, and enter notes about customer special requests.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Fill and ship orders</h3></li>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStaff prints out the Order Table for the delivery crew (from the Orders tab).  \r\n\tThe delivery crew marks it up to show which producer's food will go to which customers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStaff then enters the delivery info using the Update Lots tab.  \r\n        Sometimes filling one customer order item requires food from several producers.  \r\n        Update Lots accomodates this requirement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h3>Manage shorts</h3></li>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse the Orders tab to view shorts, change short orders, \r\n        and short notice emails to customers..\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h3>Send order emails to customers</h3></li>\r\n<p> This feature is temporarily disabled for redesign.</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Print invoices</h3></li>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse the Invoice tab to print invoices for each customer order.\r\n        The printed invoices may be delivered with the order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h3>Enter payments from customers</h3></li>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tPayments from customers can (eventually) enter the system three ways:\r\n</p>\r\n\t<ol>\r\n           <li>The customer pays invoices online with a credit card,</li>\r\n           <li>you enter customer payments and associate them with orders,</li>\r\n           <li>you just mark orders \"paid\".</li>  \r\n        </ol>\r\n<p>\r\n        Only the third method is implemented now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can mark orders \"paid\" through the Order tab, or Orders in Admin.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Compute payments to producers, processors and distributors</h3></li>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Network pays producers etc. after the customer pays the order.

That means, somebody else who now has custody of the product, rather than the original producer.  You may select the original producer as the custodian, but it is not necessary.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou may enter available lots for any product on your plans for the availability date.  See Planning below.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n\tProcessed Products\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClick the Process tab.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou may start a new Process using any of the Process Types in the dropdown list.

Ask them if you don't see the Process Type that you want, of the Process Type does not allow the number and types of entries you need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nProcesses take input lots and change them into different output lots.  For example, a culling or grading process might take unculled produce and separate it into #1's, #2's, etc.  A slaughtering and cutting process might take a live animal, slaughter it, and cut it into sellable pieces.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSome processes require available lots of their input products.  Others can start with nothing, and enter the input lots while entering the rest of the process information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou will also see a list of your processes for the current week.  If the outputs from a process have not been used, you may delete a process.

Once you have entered a production plan, you can then use your previously planned products to change or extend that plan, or select \"All Products\" to add more products to your existing plan.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, once you have entered your own plan, you will be able to see the Supply vs Demand and Projected Income tables.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe <b>Supply vs Demand</b> table combines your production plans with production plans for other producers and also demand plans from Network customers.  You can see where the Network will have more supply than demand, and where it will have more demand than supply.  You might want to change your own production plans accordingly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe <b>Projected Income</b> table shows your potential income, based on the amount of your production plans that the Network's customers have plans to buy.  This is not a guarantee of income, because customer plans may not correspond to their actual orders, and other Network producers may supply some of the demand.  If you want to see the details of supply and demand for a week (for example, to see if other producers plan to supplying some of the demand), click the date on top of the column.\r\n</p>",

So you would see Meat, Beef \r\nin the Category column for Hamburger per lb. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTypically parent products would not be sellable, plannable or inventoried. \r\nIn other words, you would not sell plain Meat or Beef, but you might sell \r\nHamburger per lb.  The categories are useful to make the product \r\ntables more readable, and also they may be used for aggregate reports: \r\nfor example, how much Meat have we sold so far this year?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sellable</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nDoes the network sell this product?  In other words, should this product appear in Order forms?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Plannable</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nShould this product appear in Planning forms, and the Supply and Demand and Planned Income tables? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inventoried</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nInventory in Food Network Software is different from most other inventory systems. \r\nIt is a distributed inventory system, managing items that are owned by other parties.  \r\nThe inventory might be on the farm in the field, at a distributor, at a processor, or in the network's \r\nown facility.   \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe reason for this distributed inventory system is so the network can keep track of \r\nwhat food is available, where it is, and what food from which producers was sent to \r\na particular customer on a particular order.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo this setting asks if this product should be managed by the network's distributed \r\ninventory system.  Note that the network can sell products that are <b>not</b> inventoried. \r\nFor example, some products might be available in such large quantities that it does not \r\nmake sense for the network to keep track of their availability.  In this case, availability \r\nfor ordering is set on the Producer Product association in a field called \"Default Available Qty\".  This field is also used in the Supply and Demand and Planned Income tables.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pay producer</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIf checked, the Food Network pays the producer for issues, deliveries and damages of this product.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen would you <b>not</b> want to pay the producer for a product?  Usually when the product is processed in some way, and the network pays the producer for the finished product, but not the inputs to the process.  For example, in a culling process, the network might pay the producer a different price for number 1's than number 2's, and nothing for rejects.  And the network would then not pay for unculled products, because the payments went for the culled products.  Or, for beef, the network might pay for hanging weight or cuts, but not for the full weight of the live animal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pay producer on terms</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIf checked, the producer of the product is paid for deliveries to customers on member terms (a number of days, as defined in Food Network settings). If not, producers are paid based on customer order payments: that is, when the customer pays for an order, the producers of products delivered on that order are due to be paid. Note: Issues to processes are always paid on member terms.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>",
